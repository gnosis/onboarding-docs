# General Dev Onboarding

## Blockchain
- [ ] This blog post [3500 word guide to Blockchain](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/11/01/ultimate-3500-word-plain-english-guide-blockchain/) gives an easy to understand
overview of blockchain and its functionality.

- [ ] This video provides a very basic [visual introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8) to the concepts behind a
Blockchain on a more technical level.


## Ethereum
- [ ] Ethereum explained - illustrated [beginners guide](https://www.upfolio.com/ultimate-ethereum-guide).

- [ ] Token standards–[a quick overview](https://medium.com/@brenn.a.hill/noobs-guide-to-understanding-erc-20-vs-erc-721-tokens-d7f5657a4ee7).

## Gnosis

- [ ] Read our [State of Gnosis](https://blog.gnosis.pm/the-state-of-gnosis-8cb9f49e3533) blog post to get an understanding of Gnosis’ vision, core
objectives, roadmap, platform model, products and research foci.

- [ ] Read the [introduction to the Gnosis Safe](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/intro_assets/) to get a basic understanding how it works.

- [ ] Read the [vision of the Gnosis Safe](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPCFPHezlbA2OawSJJo5AkwNLyWaYb9UZb2_yc4bVjw/edit) to understand what the goal is and where we are going.

## Decentralized App development

- [ ] Tutorial on smart contract development and web interfaces–[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course).
This tutorial will provide an introduction in smart contract development and how to use web3 providers to interact with them.

- [ ] The next tutorial is using the [Gnosis Safe Contract Proxy Kit](https://docs.gnosis.io/safe/docs/cpktutorial1/) to write a decentralized application.
This is one of the libraries provided by Gnosis to show how to take advantage of the Safe contracts.
